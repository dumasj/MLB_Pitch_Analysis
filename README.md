# MLB_Pitch_Analysis

Project

This goal of this project is to predict the next pitch based on information about the teams, the pitcher, the batter, and the in game situation.

Instructions

Here is a link to a zip containing a data file containing all pitches from the 2011 MLB season and the associated metadata describing the data. Please review the dataset and start outlining the way you would go about the model-building process with the goal of predicting the probability that the next thrown pitch will be a fastball, slider, change-up, etc.

We would like to see you assess the data, build a predictive model, and then evaluate that model and the success of its predictions,  with the understanding that delivering predictions with any degree of accuracy is unlikely in this short time span. This is meant to be an open-ended/creative project, so focus your time where you see best.  

Data

The data given for this project is from the 2011 MLB season.
